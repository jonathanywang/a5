(** [test_create_plant expected_age expected_max] checks that a newly created
    plant has the specified initial age and maximum age. *)

    the expected value. *)

    identifies if a plant is dead based on the expected boolean value. *)

    verifies that a new garden is created with the specified dimensions and
    initial generation count. *)
