Requirement 2.5.  You must provide a design document in "doc/design.txt" 
(also acceptable as file extensions/formats: Markdown, Word, PDF) that explains 
in English and/or math the simulation dynamics that you implemented â€” that is, the rules for how plants 
live and grow and die throughout the simulation. Describe the design process that you went through to achieve those rules, 
ncluding what other rules you might have tried and why you discarded them. Discuss why you feel that the resulting behavior 
of your simulation is interesting and organic.
